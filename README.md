### Applying these settings will override your current RStudio config files - use with care!

Package to apply custom RStudio settings programmatically.

Two options are available:

- "Minimal"

The latter installs R packages for addins I use and is tailored towards my personal RStudio / R package setup.

THe config files live in `inst/`.
